# Spam Detection with FastAPI and Machine Learning ðŸ“§

Welcome to the **Spam Detection** project! This project uses machine learning to classify emails or messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The model is integrated into a FastAPI web application, allowing users to input text and receive real-time predictions. The project uses **scikit-learn** for machine learning and **FastAPI** for building the web interface.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can input text and receive instant predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a spam dataset.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with FastAPI for a seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users input text via a web form or API request.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is preprocessed (tokenized, stopwords removed, and stemmed).
3. **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical features using a bag-of-words model.
4. **Prediction**: The features are passed to the machine learning model, which predicts whether the text is spam or ham.
5. **Result Display**: The prediction result is returned to the user.

## API Endpoint

You can also interact with the model programmatically using the `/predict/` endpoint:

### Request
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/predict/`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your input text here"
  }
  ```

### Response
- **Success**:
  ```json
  {
    "prediction": "ham"
  }
  ```
- **Error**:
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Error message"
  }
